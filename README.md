<h1>C Programming Learning Journey ðŸš€</h1>

<p>Welcome to my C programming repository! This repository is a collection of programs, examples, and concepts that I've learned over the past year in C programming. I plan to keep it updated by pushing 2 to 3 new files daily, covering various topics and practice problems.</p>

<h2>Repository Structure ðŸ“‚</h2>

<p>Each file focuses on a specific concept, problem, or project in C. Here's what you can expect:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Basic Syntax and Operators</strong>: Programs that cover the basics, like variables, operators, and control structures.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Structures</strong>: Examples and exercises on arrays, pointers, structures, linked lists, and more.</li>
  <li><strong>Algorithms</strong>: Implementations of common algorithms, from sorting and searching to more advanced ones.</li>
  <li><strong>File Handling</strong>: Programs demonstrating file operations, including reading, writing, and managing files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started ðŸ”§</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Clone this repository:
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/c-programming-learning-journey.git</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Compile a C file using GCC (or your preferred compiler):
    <pre><code>gcc filename.c -o filename<br>./filename</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Goals ðŸŽ¯</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Consistency</strong>: Add 2-3 new files daily, each focusing on a distinct concept or exercise.</li>
  <li><strong>Learning</strong>: This repository is a tool for me to reinforce my understanding and a resource for others starting with C.</li>
  <li><strong>Community</strong>: Contributions and suggestions are welcome!</li>
</ul>
